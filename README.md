## Learn about React in six week:

Choosing which JavaScript framework to learn can depend on a number of factors, such as the type of project you want to build, your personal preferences, and the job market in your area.

However, currently, some of the most popular JavaScript frameworks are:

1. React: Developed by Facebook, React is a widely used library for building user interfaces. It's known for its flexibility, modularity, and large community of developers.
2. Angular: Developed by Google, Angular is a full-featured framework for building complex, data-driven web applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and features, including dependency injection, two-way data binding, and testing.
3. Vue.js: Vue.js is a progressive framework that is easy to learn and use. It provides a simple and intuitive API, and can be used for building both simple and complex web applications.

All of these frameworks have their own strengths and weaknesses, and ultimately the choice of which to learn depends on your goals and preferences, we choose Ractjs for this roadmap.
